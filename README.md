# ImplementingAdvancedRESTfulConcernsAspNetCore3
In this course, Implementing Advanced RESTful Concerns with ASP.NET Core 3, I'm implementing advanced RESTful concerns with ASP.NET Core 3. Implementing these will lead to a better, more evolvable API. 
Things covered in this project:
- improve an API with paging, sorting, and data shaping;
- make an API more evolvable and robust with HATEOAS and advanced content negotiation, and how to deal with caching and concurrency.;
- learn about REST constraints;
- end up with a level 3 RESTful API, which is the highest possible level of maturity.
